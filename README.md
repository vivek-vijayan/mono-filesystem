# Mono File System

The Mono File System (MFS) is a simple, hierarchical file system implemented in C. It supports basic operations such as creating directories and files, navigating directories, listing directory contents, deleting files and directories, and searching for files and directories. MFS is designed to be lightweight and educational, providing a clear example of file system principles.
